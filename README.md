### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The biggest lesson I learnt while doing this project is using css flexbox to align elements in the web page. The course I am learning from taught centering elements on the webpage by solely using the margin. Css flexbox is a way more efficient way of centering elements

I also learnt how to write cleaner css code by sorting my selectors together. all the html element selectors at the top of the page and then all the class selectors follow.

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable with flexbox maybe also css grid, and then dip my toes into the world of responsive css design. I also want to start designing full web pages, and not just simple web components. I would also like to start with Javascript.


### Useful resources

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w&t=27s - This video is a crash course to html and css and gave very good practices that I could implement into my code. Also gave me inspiration for future projects I may try
